## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Have you ever wanted to navigate amazon's review images by using the keyboard? Well look no further,
now you can! This was an annoyance of mine, and thus my full motivation for implementing this simple
chrome extension. ðŸ˜… Just a simple solution, to a daily occurrence / observation of mine. 

This is a simple chrome extension that allows the user to navigate amazon customer image reviews in a more
intuitive, seamless manner -- by allowing the user to use the left and right arrow on the keyboard. It also allows the user
to close the pop-up modal by hitting the Escapse key.

### Built With
This chrome extension was built using vanilla JS and jQuery!
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)


### Installation
1. Navigate to the Chrome Webstore and download extension!
